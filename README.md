# Use What You Used First

When using a consumable item that has a number of uses or time, if you have same items already used, you can use the one with the least amount of remaining instead.

Here are that item types:

- Light Sources
- Lockpicks
- Probes
- Repair Tools

In particular, when we use that item with the quick key after loading the game, somehow a new one is chosen.
Thanks to this, there are a lot of half-used items left in our inventory. This problem is solved.

Also, when using a item without the quick key, the least amount of remaining instead, even if you do not bother to check if it has been used or not. Useful.
